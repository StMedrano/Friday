# Friday Build Status

This is the source-of-truth handoff ledger for coding agents. Update it when a major capability changes.

## Authoritative branch, hosts, and UI

- `main` is the authoritative FRIDAY build after reviewed feature work is merged.
- Live Proxmox inventory on 2026-09-21 identifies running VM102 (`friday-controller`) as the authoritative controller. VM131 is absent.
- VM100 (`ubuntu-docker`) is managed infrastructure and hosts the separate read-only Docker observer.
- CT108 (`friday-ollama`) is the local Ollama host.
- The deployed frontend is FRIDAY UI v3 under `src/`.
- PR #5 merged Incident Diagnostics + Mobile Dashboard.
- PR #11/#12 merged the multi-provider advisory assistant and local-timeout/identifier-grounding work.
- PR #14 merged the shared session-only Friday Assistant UX.

## 2026-09-21/22 read-only nic1/vmbr1 discovery

Live state differs from the proposed address map. Deployment configuration must use the verified rows below, not the proposed host-number convention, and networking must not be changed to make live state match documentation.

| VM/LXC | Hostname | vmbr1 guest interface | VLAN | nic1 address | Prefix | Gateway | Legacy vmbr0 address | Default route |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Proxmox node `home` | Proxmox VE | `vmbr1` over `nic1` | VLAN-aware trunk: 2,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,99 | none | — | none | `192.168.1.211/32` on `vmbr0` | legacy `vmbr0` via `192.168.1.254` |
| VM100 | `ubuntu-docker` | `net1` / `ens19` | 10 | `10.1.10.10` | `/24` | `10.1.10.1` | `192.168.1.124/24` on `ens18` | `ens19` via `10.1.10.1` |
| VM102 | `friday-controller` | `net1` / `eth1` | 10 | `10.1.10.11` | `/24` | `10.1.10.1` | `192.168.1.64/24` on `eth0` | `eth1` via `10.1.10.1` (one default) |
| CT108 | `friday-ollama` | `net1` / `eth1` | 10 | `10.1.10.12` (running-container interface + Proxmox config) | `/24` | `10.1.10.1` (Proxmox config) | `192.168.1.76/24` on `eth0` | configured on `eth1`; route table not directly read |
| VM110 | Umbrel / media | `net1` | 50 | not discovered | unknown | unknown | legacy address not revalidated | unknown |
| VM120 | Identity / Authentik | `net1` / `eth1` | 60 | `10.1.60.10` | `/24` | not verified | `192.168.1.73/24` | not verified from guest |
| VM131 | — | — | — | absent from live inventory | — | — | — | — |
| VM132 | Supabase production | `net1` / `eth1` | 20 | `10.1.20.10` | `/24` | not verified | `192.168.1.71/24` | not verified from guest |

Discovery sources were the local VM100 guest state plus read-only Proxmox cluster/config and QEMU guest-agent reads. `vmbr1` has no IP address and no gateway, as required. No VLAN, bridge, guest network, DHCP, DNS, firewall, Omada, or routing configuration was changed.

The proposed values `10.1.2.211`, `10.1.10.100`, `10.1.20.131`, `10.1.20.132`, and `10.1.70.120` were not verified live. In particular, Proxmox has no `10.1.2.211` interface, VM100 is `10.1.10.10`, VM131 is absent, VM132 is `10.1.20.10`, and VM120 is currently VLAN 60 at `10.1.60.10`.

### Address-reference classification

- **Current runtime/example configuration:** the VM100 observer examples now use verified nic1 `10.1.10.10:3199`.
- **Legacy/rollback configuration:** Proxmox `192.168.1.211` remains the only verified reachable management API path. It is labeled legacy until a nic1 management address is verified.
- **Current CT108 runtime/default/example configuration:** the running-container interface API verifies CT108 `eth1` at `10.1.10.12/24`; VM102 routes to it over `eth1` with source `10.1.10.11` and passes TCP/11434, `/api/tags`, and `/api/chat`. The three agent profile defaults now use `http://10.1.10.12:11434`.
- **Legacy CT108 references:** `192.168.1.70:11434` remains only in intentionally historical design/plan documents and isolated test fixtures. CT108's currently observed legacy vmbr0 address is `192.168.1.76/24`, not `.70`.
- **Test fixtures:** remaining `192.168.1.x` values in `*.test.*` are isolated adapter/provider fixtures and do not configure deployment.
- **Historical documentation:** files under `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` preserve the addresses used by their original approved designs and plans.

## Current deployed controller baseline

The last explicitly recorded VM102 production baseline predates the local Agent Platform Phase 1 branch. Existing production validation established a healthy Friday container on port `3010`, read-only Proxmox/VM100 visibility, Groq -> Gemini -> CT108 Ollama assistant fallback, exact infrastructure grounding, and no infrastructure mutation authority.

Do not infer that PR #19's current head has been deployed merely because its CI is green. On 2026-09-22, VM102's clean checkout was at `a12b540` while GitHub and the local PR branch were at `a2ff409`. The running container started on 2026-09-12, uses legacy CT108 agent URLs `192.168.1.76:11434`, and predates shared-composer auto-routing. The live registry list/status/detail endpoints now return 200, but full rollout acceptance remains required.

## Monitoring, diagnostics, mobile, and assistant — merged

The following capabilities are already part of `main`:

- durable monitoring/incidents with read-only incident APIs;
- fixed, sanitized VM100 observer diagnostics and explicit bounded log inspection;
- purpose-built mobile operations shell at `(max-width: 700px)`;
- multi-provider advisory Friday Assistant;
- one shared browser-memory assistant session across Overview, FRIDAY, and mobile surfaces;
- provider/model/fallback provenance;
- fresh normalized Friday state authoritative over conversation history;
- no server-side assistant conversation persistence;
- no infrastructure execution authority.

PR #14 is merged; the old “finish the Friday Assistant experience” milestone is retired.

## Local Agent Platform Phase 1 — implemented in draft PR #19

Source branch: `feature/friday-local-agent-platform-phase1-20260830`.

Implemented behavior:

- Agent Spec v1.1 with deployment-independent `model.profile` references;
- Git `agents/` definitions are authoritative;
- self-hosted Supabase stores only runtime registry state in exactly two tables: `friday_agents` and `friday_agent_registry_state`;
- server-only model profiles `local-router`, `local-general`, and `local-coder` resolve to Ollama;
- explicit/manual agent override;
- deterministic routing for strong registered agent matches;
- bounded CT108 local-router classification for ambiguous requests;
- matched agents execute inference on CT108/local Ollama only and never fall back to cloud assistant providers;
- agent requests receive a fresh normalized Friday overview;
- server-side `POST /api/assistant` automatically routes matched prompts to local agents before the existing assistant provider chain while reusing the same fresh overview;
- manual Agents workspace displays registry state, definition metadata, local provenance, sync control, and direct ask flow;
- agent API surface contains exactly the Phase 1 registry/route/ask operations documented in `API_CONTRACT.md`;
- successful agent replies expose `mode:"local-agent"`, `provider:"ollama"`, model/profile provenance, and `execution.performed=false`;
- there is no agent executor, shell/SSH path, restart endpoint, delete/edit/create API, durable agent memory, task system, approval system, or infrastructure mutation authority.

Task 8 regression gates are part of CI: exact two-table schema validation, local-only matched-agent behavior, no-execution regression, secret-boundary scan, and agent-route/shell safety scans.

Shared-composer implementation tests cover deterministic Proxmox routing, same-overview identity, response provenance, grounded output, no cloud/general fallback after a matched local failure, safe no-match fallback, routing-service failure fallback, and `execution.performed=false`. Live shared-composer acceptance remains pending deployment.

### Verification result — 2026-09-22

- `make verify`: **passed** after the CT108 nic1 default migration, in a temporary Node 22 + Make + Docker Compose tool container because the discovery host lacks host-installed Node/Make.
- Frontend: **85/85 tests passed** across 19 files.
- Server/observer/scripts: **225/225 tests passed**.
- Production TypeScript/Vite build: **passed**.
- Base, live-overlay, and observer Compose validation: **passed**.
- Network configuration regression: **passed** — all three active agent defaults resolve to `10.1.10.12:11434`, no active default uses `192.168.1.70`, and VLAN 80 remains absent.
- VM100 observer nic1 health: `http://10.1.10.10:3199/health` returned 200.
- VM102 Friday nic1 health: `http://10.1.10.11:3010/healthz` returned 200 in live mode; `/api/overview` returned 200.
- Agent list, registry status, and `proxmox-observer` detail on the deployed controller: **200** on the later 2026-09-22 inspection. The status reports one synced agent, no rejections, and `sourceCommit:null`; the agent checksum matches the checked-in definition.
- VM102 `make preflight`: **passed** on 2026-09-22 with a process-local Git safe-directory override; the deployed checkout is clean on the PR branch at older commit `a12b540`.
- `make update`: **not run** because the script intentionally switches to `main`, which would not deploy this unmerged PR. The repo-local deployment skill permits an explicitly reviewed `docker compose up -d --build friday` for a PR checkpoint.
- `make health`: **not run after a new deployment**, because the PR head has not been deployed.
- Live old-build route/ask/composer comparison: `/api/agents/route` selected `proxmox-observer` with confidence `0.98`; direct `/api/agents/proxmox-observer/ask` returned `mode:local-agent`, `provider:ollama`, model `qwen3:4b-instruct`, and `execution.performed:false`. The shared `/api/assistant` returned Groq/cloud provenance and no agent ID, confirming the running build predates the PR head's agent-first composer change.

### Agents UI acceptance — 2026-09-21

Automated component and responsive CSS suites passed. Coverage confirms registry status/list/detail rendering, model/profile, scope, tools, checksum, registry sync, manual Ask, shared composer integration, and absence of Restart, Execute, Delete, Approve, Shell, Edit agent, and Create agent controls. Live desktop/mobile visual acceptance and manual Ask remain pending because the deployed registry is unavailable.

### CT108/Ollama migration status — verified 2026-09-22

- Proxmox configuration discovery: **passed** — CT108 `net1` is `eth1`, attached to `vmbr1`, VLAN 10, configured as `10.1.10.12/24` with gateway `10.1.10.1`; legacy `eth0` has no gateway.
- Running-container interface verification: **passed** through the read-only Proxmox LXC interfaces API — CT108 reports `eth1=10.1.10.12/24` and `eth0=192.168.1.76/24`.
- Authoritative controller path: **passed** — VM102 reports `10.1.10.12 dev eth1 src 10.1.10.11` and exactly one default route, via `10.1.10.1 dev eth1`.
- TCP/11434 from VM102: **passed**.
- `GET /api/tags` from VM102: **passed** — includes `qwen3:4b-instruct` and `qwen3:4b`.
- `POST /api/chat` from VM102: **passed** with `qwen3:4b-instruct`, `done:true`, and non-empty assistant content.
- Source configuration migration: **performed** — all three active agent profile defaults use `http://10.1.10.12:11434`; deployed VM102 `.env` migration remains part of the deployment checkpoint.

### Supabase rollout blocker — observed 2026-09-22

- VM132 `supabase-prod` is reachable from VM102 at verified nic1 `10.1.20.10`; the route uses VM102 `eth1` via `10.1.10.1`.
- The Supabase gateway is listening on TCP/8000, PostgreSQL/Supavisor ports are listening, and the service-role credential is present without being printed.
- Earlier on 2026-09-22, `supabase-rest` was unhealthy, authenticated service-role REST returned 503, and authenticated PostgreSQL queries failed because the server could not read `global/pg_filenode.map` (`Permission denied`). The database then restarted automatically once at 12:36:47 UTC.
- Later checks returned `supabase-rest:healthy`, service-role REST 200, successful authenticated SQL queries, and no additional restart. The data directory owner was observed as UID/GID `1000:1000` before restart; after restart the top-level directory and `pg_filenode.map` were UID 100, matching the PostgreSQL process UID. The mechanism that changed ownership has not been established, so this recovery is not yet evidence of stability.
- Both Friday registry tables exist in the `postgres` database with one agent row and one state row. Read-only inspection on 2026-09-22 confirmed exactly the two `friday_` tables, all expected columns/types/nullability/defaults, and each primary key against `supabase/migrations/202608300001_friday_agent_registry.sql`; no schema migration write is currently needed.
- The existing Supabase deployment `.env` is mode `0664`; this pre-existing credential-file permission issue was observed but not changed because infrastructure permission repair is outside this Friday application task.
- No VM102 `.env` migration, PR-head controller deployment, shared-composer live acceptance, or visual UI acceptance was performed. Investigate the ownership incident and validate sustained Supabase query readiness before deploying.

### Remaining Phase 1 rollout acceptance

Before PR #19 is ready to merge:

1. establish sustained Supabase SQL/PostgREST readiness and investigate the UID/GID ownership incident; the existing two-table schema has been validated and needs no migration write;
2. arrange VM102 access to the owner-only `.env` and clean checkout, preserve `.env`, then update the three agent URLs to `http://10.1.10.12:11434` without changing unrelated integration credentials;
3. fast-forward VM102's PR branch to the reviewed GitHub head and rebuild only the Friday controller with base Compose; do not use `make update`, which switches to `main`;
4. run `make health` and verify normal health/read-only integrations remain unchanged;
5. sync the registry and verify list, detail, and status against the deployed definition checksum;
6. verify Proxmox routing, direct Proxmox agent ask, and shared-composer automatic routing all return local Ollama provenance and `execution.performed=false`;
7. complete desktop and phone Agents workspace acceptance, then obtain explicit approval before merging PR #19.

Do not represent those live rollout checks as complete until they are actually performed.

## VM100 observer security boundary

Docker's native TCP API must never be exposed. Inventory/diagnostic IDs come from sanitized current inventory. The observer must never gain restart, stop, kill, exec, remove, image creation, volume mutation, network mutation, archive write, or arbitrary Docker-path proxy behavior.

## Not implemented yet

- Omada authenticated read-only site/device/health adapter.
- AdGuard authenticated read-only API/statistics adapter.
- Uptime Kuma/Prometheus/Grafana native adapters.
- Application authentication and RBAC.
- Durable action audit/action request store.
- Human approval queue and global automation kill switch.
- Agent tool executor or infrastructure mutation endpoints.
- Durable agent memory/task orchestration.
- Notification delivery.
- Voice input pipeline.

## Next product milestone

Finish **Local Agent Platform Phase 1 live rollout and acceptance** without adding execution authority. After that, continue read-only adapter coverage and design authentication/RBAC + durable audit + approval + kill-switch prerequisites before any controlled action work.

## Safety gate

Do not implement infrastructure-changing agent or assistant actions until authentication, role policy, explicit approval, durable action audit logging, and the global automation kill switch exist and are tested.
